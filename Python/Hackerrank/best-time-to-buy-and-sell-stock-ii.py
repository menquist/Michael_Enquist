#Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

#Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). 
#However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
