Sample Challenge 
This is a simple challenge to get things started. Given a sorted array () 
and a number (), can you print the index location of  in the array?

The next section describes the input format. You can often skip it, 
if you are using included methods.

Input Format 
There will be three lines of input:

 V- the value that has to be searched.
 n- the size of the array.
 ar-  numbers that make up the array.
Output Format 
Output the index of V  in the array.

The next section describes the constraints and ranges of the input. 
You should check this section to know the range of the input.
'''

v, n = input(), input()
print(input().split().index(v))
