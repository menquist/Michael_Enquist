# Machine Learning From Scratch: Credit Default

## About
The purpose of this project is to improve my comprehension of some of the fundamental Machine Learning models and algorithms from scratch by applying it with the Credit Default dataset.

This is just a toy exercise with teaching objectives.The simulated Customer default records from a made up credit card company. The simulated dataset is partially exported from package 'ISLR' from R with added on features such as: Age, LTI, and Monthly Payments Delayed.

The data is made up and it is not applicable on any actual company. I'm interested in predicting whether an individual will default on his or her credit card payment, on the basis of annual income and monthly credit card balance. The statistical methods that I'm following through are based from "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"
