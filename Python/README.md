# Python: Implementations of Machine Learning Models and Algorithms

## About

In folder contains materials that I've learned from Applied Quantitative Methods (AQM), online learning algorithms from Leetcode and Hackerrank. This repository aims to cover everything from linear regression to deep learning and between projects and workshops.

    + [AQM](AQM/)
    	* Contains learning materials from Applied Quantitative Methods (AQM). The Python scripts contains machine learning use cases and applications from sentimental analysis, topic modelling, and training neural nets.
    + [Finance Portfolio](Finance_Portfolio/)
    	* My recent financial projects aligning towards modeling interest rates, derivatives, stock options methods. As well; statistical analysis on time series, nonlinearity, and Algo trading platform project.
    + [Generative Adversarial Network](Generative_Adversarial_Network/)
    	* I am curious applying GANs architecture on game theory applications, computer vision, and music. So far, I'm working through an application on using Mnist image data.
    + [Hackerrank](Hackerrank/)
    + [Leetcode](Leetcode/)
    + [ML from Scratch - Credit Default](ML_from_Scratch-Credit_Default/)
    	* Building statistical learning models from scratch and applying them through Credit Default dataset.
    + [Restricted Boltzmann Machine](Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine/)
    	* I am curious about applying RBM on time series data, particularly, weather temperature and precipitation. So far, this application is on Tensorflow Mnist image data. More research is needed on applying RBM
    + [Seq2Seq Chatbot and Doc2vec](Seq2Seq _Chatbot_and_Doc2vec/)
    	* This is a NLP project aligning with City of Torontoâ€™s SMART initiative. The application was used at Elevate Hackathon event. The Application includes a chatbot and Doc2vec text similarity search grid 
    + [Text Summerizer](Text_Summerizer/)
    	* A text summarization and keyword extraction package based on TextRank.
