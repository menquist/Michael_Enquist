# Overview

This is my portfolio repository on recent or previous projects. I included the working materials that I've learned through the Applied Quantitative Methods (AQM) workshop and applied it through my undergrad at SFU. The most recent small projects contain a brief summary in each section in Python or R.

## About Me

I am passionate about data science and machine learning and its applications to corporate decision making. I've found that the most efficient and fun way for me to learn is doing small side projects in parallel to my studies and employment.

If you want to know more about me, please feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:michael_enquist@hotmail.com) me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-enquist-006400a3/). I would love to hear from you.
